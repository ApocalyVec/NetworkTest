# NetworkTest
Test text communication between one server and client.

You'll neet java 1.8 and JFoneix to run this demo application.

  Get java 1.8 here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
  Get Jfoenix here: http://www.jfoenix.com/
  
Start two run instance of the application, choose server for the first one, enter a desired network port. And the server will
wait on client's message.

Main window:

Server window:
![server](https://github.com/ApocalyVec/NetworkTest/blob/dev/images/server.jpg)

In the second run, choose client, enter "localhost" for server name, and the same network port as the server.

Client window:
![client](https://github.com/ApocalyVec/NetworkTest/blob/dev/images/client.jpg)

Client and server together:
![clientAndServer](https://github.com/ApocalyVec/NetworkTest/blob/dev/images/clientAndServer.jpg)

Now you can send messages from the client to the server.
